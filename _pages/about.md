Nick Psaris is a quantitative developer with over two decades of
experience building automated option market making and equity stat-arb
backtesting and trading systems as well as data and analytic
platforms. He is a [CFA][] charterholder and holds a Masters in
Computational Finance ([MSCF][]) from the [Tepper School of
Business][] at [Carnegie Mellon University][]. Nick wrote [Q Tips:
Fast, Scalable and Maintainable Kdb+][q tips] based on his years of
practical experience developing production trading systems in
[q][]. His second book, [Fun Q: A Functional Introduction to Machine
Learning in Q][fun q], uses the expressive [q][] language to guide
readers through implementing twelve machine learning algorithms from
scratch. Nick is currently an [adjunct professor][] for the [Market
Microstructure and Algorithmic Trading][mmat] class at [Carnegie
Mellon University][]'s [MSCF][] program and a Managing Director in
[Bank of America][]'s Equity Central Risk Book (CRB) desk.

# Hong Kong
Nick moved to Hong Kong in 2006 and built an equity portfolio trading
and backtesting system in [q][]. After spending three years at [Liquid
Capital Markets Hong Kong][] building a high frequency automated
market making system in [q][], he then built an inventory optimization
platform in [q][] at a top tier American investment bank.

# Q Tips
Nick wrote [Q Tips][] based on his years of practical experience
developing production trading systems in [q][]. Published in 2015, [Q
Tips][] teaches you everything you need to know to build a fully
functional CEP engine. Advanced topics include profiling an active
kdb+ server, derivatives pricing and histogram charting. As each new
topic is introduced, tips are highlighted to help you write better
[q][]. A [book review][q tips book review] was published in
[Vector][], the Journal of the British APL Association.

# New York II
In 2016, Nick moved back to New York and joined his firm's Equity CRB
desk where he manages the data and analytics platform built with
[q][].  Most recently, Nick built the [PREDICTIFY][] cross-asset
client interest model using a collaborative filtering machine learning
algorithm.

# MSCF
Beginning in 2018, Nick has been co-teaching the [Market
Microstructure and Algorithmic Trading][mmat] class for [Carnegie
Mellon University][]'s [MSCF][] program as an [adjunct professor][].
Students use [q][] and [jupyter][] notebooks to analyze high-frequency
tick data sourced from [NYSE Daily TAQ][], [CME DataMine][], and [ICE
Cryptocurrencies][].

# Fun Q
Combining his love of data and efficient [q][] algorithms, Nick
published [Fun Q][] in 2020. [Fun Q][] demonstrates how many common
machine learning algorithms can be efficiently implemented in [q][] --
thus bringing the code to the data, instead of the data to the code.
Each algorithm is broken into its basic building blocks and then
rebuilt from scratch.  Famous machine-learning data sets are used to
motivate each chapter as advanced [q][] idioms are introduced as well.
A [book review][fun q book review] was published in [Vector][], the
Journal of the British APL Association.
