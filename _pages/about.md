Nick Psaris is a quantitative developer with over two decades of
experience building automated option market making and equity statarb
backtesting and trading systems as well as data and analytic
platforms. He is a CFA charterholder and holds a Masters in
Computational Finance (MSCF) from the Tepper School of Business at
Carnegie Mellon University. Nick wrote [Q Tips: Fast, Scalable and
Maintainable Kdb+](http://q-tips.net) based on his years of practical
experience developing production trading systems in q. His second
book, [Fun Q: A Functional Introduction to Machine Learning in
Q](http://fun-q.net), uses the expressive q language to guide readers
through implementing twelve machine learning algorithms from
scratch. Nick is currently an adjunct professor for the Market
Microstructure and Algorithmic Trading class at Carnegie Mellon's MSCF
program and a Managing Director in Bank of America's Equity Central
Risk Book (CRB) desk.

# New York I
After graduating [Duke University](http://www.duke.edu) with a degree
in Physics and Chinese, he began his career in finance at [Morgan
Stanley](http://www.morganstanley.com) in New York. He obtained his
[CFA](http://www.cfainstitute.org) charter in 2003, and a [Masters in
Computational Finance](http://www.cmu.edu/mscf) from the [Tepper
School of Business at Carnegie Mellon
University](http://tepper.cmu.edu) in 2006.

# Hong Kong
Nick moved to Hong Kong in 2006 and built an equity portfolio trading
and backtesting system in
[q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(programming_language_from_Kx_Systems)). After
spending three years at [Liquid Capital Markets Hong
Kong](http://www.liquidcapital.com/hong-kong) building a high
frequency automated market making system in q, he then built an
inventory optimization platform in q at a top tier American investment
bank.

# Q Tips
Nick wrote [Q Tips](http://q-tips.net) based on his years of practical
experience developing production trading systems in q. Published in
2015, [Q Tips](http://q-tips.net) teaches you everything you need to
know to build a fully functional CEP engine. Advanced topics include
profiling an active kdb+ server, derivatives pricing and histogram
charting. As each new topic is introduced, tips are highlighted to
help you write better q.

# New York II
In 2016, Nick moved back to New York and joined his firm's Equity CRB
desk where he manages the data and analytics platform built with q.
Most recently, Nick built the
[PREDICTIFY](https://uspto.report/TM/90681330) cross-asset client
interest model using a collaborative filtering machine learning
algorithm.

# MSCF
Beginning in 2018, Nick has been co-teaching the [Market
Microstructure and Algorithmic
Trading](https://www.cmu.edu/mscf/academics/curriculum/46982-market-microstructure-and-algorithmic-trading.html)
class for Carnegie Mellon University's
[MSCF](https://www.cmu.edu/mscf/) program as an [adjunct
professor](https://www.cmu.edu/mscf/academics/faculty.html).  Students
use [kdb+](https://kx.com/) and [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
notebooks to analyze high-frequency tick data sourced from NYSE [Daily
TAQ](https://www.nyse.com/market-data/historical/daily-taq), CME
[DataMine](https://www.cmegroup.com/confluence/display/EPICSANDBOX/CME+DataMine),
and ICE
[Cryptocurrencies](https://www.theice.com/market-data/cryptocurrencies).

# Fun Q
Combining his love of data and efficient q algorithms, Nick published
[Fun Q](http://fun-q.net) in 2020. [Fun Q](http://fun-q.net)
demonstrates how many common machine learning algorithms can be
efficiently implemented in q -- thus bringing the code to the data,
instead of the data to the code.  Each algorithm is broken into its
basic building blocks and then rebuilt from scratch.  Famous
machine-learning data sets are used to motivate each chapter as
advanced q idioms are introduced as well.

# Competitions
To promote interest in q, Nick has lead a few coding competitions.

- [Computing HKID Check Digits](https://kx.com/blog/computing-check-digits-contest-with-kdb/)
- [Computing VIN Check Digits](https://kx.com/blog/nicks-kdb-coding-contest/)
- [Loading Data from the MNIST Database](https://kx.com/blog/kxcon2016-puzzle-challenge/)
- [Compute the Mastermind Score](https://kx.com/blog/kdb-mastermind-challenge/)

# Podcasts
Nick has been a panelist and guest on the [The Array Cast](https://www.arraycast.com/) podcast.

# In The News
Nick has been mentioned in reference to the Q programming language on [efinancialcareers](https://www.efinancialcareers.com/).

- [The coding language that will get you the best jobs in banking](https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2020/09/best-coding-language-for-banking-jobs)

# Emacs
Nick uses Emacs in all parts of his life.  He is the author of
[q-mode](https://melpa.org/#/q-mode), which adds syntax highlighting to
q code and the ability to inject code into both local q processes and
remote q servers.  [Q Tips](http://q-tips.net) and [Fun
Q](http://fun-q.net) where written using
[q-mode](https://melpa.org/#/q-mode) and
[adoc-mode](https://melpa.org/#/adoc-mode) for editing
[AsciiDoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/) files.

# Pediatric Cancer
Nick is passionate about finding a cure for childhood cancer.  In
addition to
[supporting](https://thed10.com/blog/j-s-bulls-why-we-do-this-in-the-first-place)
[The D10](https://thed10.com/)
[mission](https://thed10.com/our-mission), he has raised over $100,000
for pediatric cancer research by [shaving
bald](https://www.stbaldricks.org/participants/nickgoesbald) at the
annual [St. Baldrick's event in Hong
Kong](https://www.stbaldricks.org/events/hkis2023) and has joined the ranks of: Knight of the Bald Table.
